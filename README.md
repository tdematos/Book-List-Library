# Book-List-Library
A library for storing all of your favorite books

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project.

HTML:
I used HTML to create the skeleton for this project so that I had an idea of what I had to work with.

CSS:
I used CSS to style the HTML elements as well as the DOM elements.

JavaScript:
Most of my concentration went to writing JavaScript, since this project is JS-heavy. I created an array to add objects "books" that I can reference and see on a page.
